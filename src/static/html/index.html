                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I am a seasoned software engineer with a specialized background in aerospace technology, where I have made significant contributions to both helicopter autopilot systems and ion propulsion control for satellites. My career is marked by a proven ability to adapt and excel across various environments, from the rigorous demands of space technology at Amazon's Project Kuiper, where I played a key role in propulsion system development, to the expansive cloud infrastructure at AWS CloudWatch Logs.</p>
                <p>My technical expertise is deeply rooted in systems programming with a current preference for Rust, although I have extensive experience with C++ and C, which underscores my capability to handle low-level system interactions and performance-critical applications. My work spans from large-scale enterprises to smaller, dynamic companies where I've had the opportunity to significantly influence product development.</p>
                <p>I possess a unique blend of software engineering skills with a practical understanding of hardware, thanks to collaborative projects with electronics engineers. This interdisciplinary experience has not only honed my technical skills but also my ability to integrate software solutions with hardware components effectively. </p>
                <!-- <p>Driven by a passion for space exploration, my career objective is to contribute to humanity's quest to become a space-faring civilization. I am committed to leveraging my skills in software development, system integration, and my generalist approach to problem-solving to advance technologies that will one day propel us beyond Earth.</p> -->
