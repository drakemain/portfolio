                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>I am a software engineer with a background in <span class="highlight">aerospace technology</span>, where I have made significant contributions to both <span class="highlight">helicopter autopilot</span> systems and <span class="highlight">ion propulsion control for satellites</span>. My career is marked by a proven ability to adapt and excel across various environments, from the rigorous demands of space technology at <span class="highlight">Amazon's Project Kuiper</span>, where I played a key role in <span class="highlight">propulsion system</span> development, to the expansive cloud infrastructure at <span class="highlight">AWS CloudWatch Logs</span>.</p>
                <p>My technical expertise is deeply rooted in systems programming with a current preference for <span class="highlight">Rust</span>, although I have extensive experience with <span class="highlight">C++ and C</span>, which underscores my capability to handle low-level system interactions and performance-critical applications. While I do have preferences, I consider myself to be <span class="highlight">language agnostic</span>, prefering to think more about the flow of the underlying data than the medium used to control it. My work spans from large-scale enterprises to smaller, dynamic companies where I've had the opportunity to significantly influence product development.</p>
                <p>I possess a unique blend of software engineering skills with a practical understanding of hardware, thanks to <span class="highlight">collaborative</span> projects with electronics engineers. This <span class="highlight">interdisciplinary experience</span> has not only honed my technical skills but also my ability to integrate software solutions with hardware components effectively. </p>
                <!-- <p>Driven by a passion for space exploration, my career objective is to contribute to humanity's quest to become a space-faring civilization. I am committed to leveraging my skills in software development, system integration, and my generalist approach to problem-solving to advance technologies that will one day propel us beyond Earth.</p> -->
